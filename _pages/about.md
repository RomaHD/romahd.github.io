I am a postdoc in Applied Bioinformatics Division at German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ).

My research interests are focused around computational methods in drug discovery and development, from de-novo drug design and QSAR modelling to biomarker identification and drug response / survival prediction.

Favorite data types:
* Genomic
* Chemical
* Microscopy
